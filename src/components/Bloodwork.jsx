          Blood work analyses provide a lot of key information about a personâ€™s
          health, and I work in collaboration with healthcare professionals to
          address potential risks, and make dietary changes as necessary.

        <p>
          Tracking these results will help me recommend adjustments in our
          training to optimize results and ensure continued progress.
